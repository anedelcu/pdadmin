     * <p>New Task:
     *
     * <p>As a doctor, I should have the ability to log in and import a csv file with multiple
     * patients details, and those patients should be added into our database. The CSV file will
     * have the following columns:
     * First name, Last Name, DOB, Doctor Assigned, Doctor Notes, Diagnostic, Insurance Member Id, Insurance Group Id

     Once the doctor will upload this file, they will be able to see the patients in the database, ONLY if the patient is associated with that respective doctor
